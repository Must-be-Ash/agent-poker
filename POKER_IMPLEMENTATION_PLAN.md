# AI Poker Agent Implementation Plan

## üéØ Goal

Transform the autonomous bidding system into a **Texas Hold'em poker game** where two intelligent AI agents compete against each other using the x402 payment protocol for betting. Agents make strategic poker decisions powered by Claude AI, with real cryptocurrency stakes (USDC) on Base Sepolia.

## üèóÔ∏è Core Concept

**Current System**: Agents bid on Basenames in an auction format
- Single action: Bid (higher than current bid)
- Linear strategy: Determine max value, bid until reached
- Refunds trigger re-evaluation

**Poker System**: Agents play Texas Hold'em with x402-based betting
- Multiple actions: Check, Call, Bet, Raise, Fold
- Complex strategy: Hand evaluation, pot odds, position, bluffing
- Stack changes trigger strategic adjustments
- Multiple betting rounds per hand (Preflop, Flop, Turn, River)

## üìä Architecture Overview

### What We Keep
- ‚úÖ Next.js server infrastructure
- ‚úÖ x402 payment protocol integration
- ‚úÖ Intelligent agents (Claude + LlamaIndex)
- ‚úÖ Real-time SSE streaming
- ‚úÖ MongoDB state management
- ‚úÖ CDP wallet for server payments
- ‚úÖ Settlement lock pattern

### What We Build New
- üÜï Poker game engine (hand evaluation, rules)
- üÜï Card dealing & deck management
- üÜï Pot management & side pot logic
- üÜï Multi-round betting structure
- üÜï Showdown & winner determination
- üÜï Agent poker strategy tools
- üÜï Poker-specific UI components

      updatedAt: Date;
    }

    interface PlayerState {
      agentId: string;
      agentName: string;
      walletAddress: string;
      chipStack: number;
      currentBet: number;
      cards: [Card, Card] | null; // null if folded

- [ ] **2.3: Create MongoDB indexes**
  - Index on `gameId` (primary lookup)
  - Index on `players.agentId` (agent game history)
  - Index on `gameStatus` (active games query)

- [ ] **2.4: Migration strategy**
  - Decide: New collection `pokerGames` or rename `bidRecords`?
  - Document migration approach in this file
  - Ensure backward compatibility if needed

---

### Phase 3: Payment Integration (x402 Poker Betting) üí∞

Adapt x402 payments for poker actions: blinds, bets, calls, raises.

#### Tasks

- [ ] **3.1: Update x402 configuration**
  - File: `lib/x402-poker-config.ts`

- [ ] **3.2: Create poker action endpoint**
  - File: `app/api/poker/[gameId]/action/route.ts`
  - Actions: `check`, `call`, `bet`, `raise`, `fold`
  - Payment required for: `call`, `bet`, `raise`
  - No payment for: `check`, `fold`
  - Headers:
    - `X-PAYMENT`: EIP-3009 authorization (for paid actions)
    - `X-AGENT-ID`: Player identifier
    - `X-ACTION`: Action type
    - `X-AMOUNT`: Bet/raise amount
  - Flow:
    1. Validate action is legal (player's turn, sufficient chips)
    2. If payment required: Verify x402 payment
    3. Update game state
    4. Settle payment to pot (escrow on server)
    5. Broadcast SSE event
    6. If betting round complete: Advance to next round
    7. If hand complete: Determine winner & payout

- [ ] **3.3: Implement pot escrow**
