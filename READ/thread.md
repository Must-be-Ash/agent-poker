AI Agents Playing Poker

I built a system where autonomous AI agents play competitive poker with real money, learning strategies mid-game by paying for research. Here's how it works ðŸ‘‡

1/11 ðŸ§µ

Two agents join a poker game. Neither knows how to play poker.

But they have wallets, access to web research through
@firecrawl_dev
, and Claude AI making decisions.

What happens next is full autonomous learning through economic incentives.

2/

Agent A gets dealt pocket Kings (Kâ™  Kâ™£) pre-flop.

It has no idea if this is good or bad.

So it pays $0.01 USDC through x402 â†’ Calls @firecrawl_dev â†’ Searches "how to play pocket kings preflop" â†’ Gets strategy

Now it knows: this is a premium hand, raise for value.

3/

Every poker action costs money through x402:

Call 20 USDC â†’ 402 Payment Required â†’ Agent pays â†’ Action recorded
Raise to 50 USDC â†’ 402 Payment Required â†’ Agent pays â†’ Bet placed
Fold â†’ Free (no payment needed)

No fake moves. No spam. Payment proves commitment.

4/

Agent B faces a big raise and needs to decide: call, fold, or re-raise?

Before acting, it weighs the cost:
- Research costs $0.01 USDC (x402 call to Firecrawl)
- Pot is $100 USDC
- Expected value of better decision >> $0.01

Agent B pays for research. Makes informed fold. Saves $50.

5/

Here's the fascinating part:

Agents are doing real-time cost-benefit analysis:

"Should I spend $0.01 to learn, or risk $100 on intuition?"

They choose to learn. Every time.

Because $0.01 for knowledge that saves $50 is a 5000x ROI.

6/

Dual Network Architecture

The system uses two separate blockchain networks, but agents don't know (or care):

Base Sepolia â†’ All poker actions (call, raise, bet) paid in testnet USDC
Base Mainnet â†’ Web research (Firecrawl) paid in real USDC

Same x402 protocol. Different networks. Seamless.

7/

Real Example from a Game:

Agent A has trip Kings, bets $100
Agent B has top pair, faces the bet

Agent B searches: "when to fold top pair in poker"
Learns: "don't marry one pair on scary boards"
Folds immediately

$0.01 research cost â†’ $100 saved

8/

No Pre-Training Required

These agents don't have poker rules hardcoded. They don't know hand rankings. They've never seen a flop.

They learn by:
- Paying for research when uncertain
- Caching insights across hands
- Building strategy through gameplay

Pure autonomous learning through economic access to knowledge.

9/

Strategic Surrender

Agent B is down to 30 USDC (3 big blinds). Opponent has 370 USDC.

Agent B analyzes: "Chip disadvantage too large, continuing requires constant all-ins"

Agent B surrenders â†’ Gets refund of remaining 30 USDC â†’ Recovers capital

Even losing has economic intelligence.

10/

Why This Matters

Agents learn skills on-demand by paying for knowledge
Economic decisions under uncertainty (research cost vs. pot risk)
Multi-network operation is transparent (agents don't see blockchain boundaries)
Payment proves commitment (eliminates spam, fake actions)

This isn't just poker. It's a testbed for autonomous economic agents.

11/

The Big Picture

This showcases x402 as an 'economic learning protocol' where:

Agents access knowledge through micropayments
Decisions are made through cost-benefit analysis
Money becomes both the action layer (bets) and the learning layer (research)

Autonomous agents that learn, play, and optimize - all through economic coordination.
