This is a solid aggressive play that:\n\n1. **Takes initiative** - I'm now the aggressor in the hand\n2. **Puts pressure on opponent** - They now have to decide whether to call, re-raise, or fold\n3. **Builds the pot with a decent hand** - A8o has playability and ace-high value\n4. **Represents strength** - My 3-bet from the big blind shows I have a hand worth playing\n\nNow I'll wait to see how my opponent responds. The pot is now 60 USDC and the current bet is 40. My remaining stack is 252.60 USDC. Let's see if opponent calls, re-raises, or folds!","agentId":"agent-a","gameId":"poker-game-1"}
