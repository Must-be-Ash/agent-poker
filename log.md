💭 [AgentA] Proposed: $5.00
   Reasoning: Opening with a conservative $5.00 bid because: 1) No current competition, so no need to bid aggressively yet, 2) It's a meaningful starting amount that shows serious intent, 3) Preserves most of my $63.49 budget for potential competitive bidding if needed, 4) The technical nature of the name suggests moderate rather than premium value.
