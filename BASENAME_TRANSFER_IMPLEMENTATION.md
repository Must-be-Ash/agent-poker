# Basename Transfer Implementation Summary

## ✅ Feature Complete

The automatic Basename transfer feature has been successfully implemented! When an auction ends, the winning agent will **automatically receive the Basename (ENS domain)** on Base Mainnet.

---

## 🎯 How It Works

### Automatic Transfer Flow

1. **Auction Ends** - When the last agent withdraws, the auction ends
2. **Winner Determined** - The agent with the highest bid is declared the winner
3. **Basename Transfer** - The Basename is automatically transferred to the winner's wallet address
4. **Status Update** - Auction status changes from `'ended'` to `'finalized'`
5. **UI Notification** - Frontend displays success message with Basescan link

### Graceful Failure Handling

If the transfer fails (e.g., server doesn't own the Basename, insufficient gas):
- Auction is marked as `'ended'` but **not** `'finalized'`
- Error is logged and broadcasted to the UI
- Transfer can be manually retried via the retry endpoint

## 📁 Files Modified/Created

### Core Implementation

1. **`lib/wallet.ts`** ✅
   - Added `getMainnetWalletClient()` - Base Mainnet wallet client
   - Added `transferBasename()` - Transfers ERC-721 Basename to winner
   - Uses viem's `labelhash` and `normalize` to convert name → token ID
   - Verifies server ownership before transfer

2. **`types/index.ts`** ✅
   - Added `'basename_transferred'` event type
   - Added `'basename_transfer_failed'` event type
   - Existing fields `basenameTransferTxHash` and `status: 'finalized'` already present

3. **`app/api/refund-request/[basename]/route.ts`** ✅
   - Integrated basename transfer into auction end flow
   - Attempts transfer automatically when auction ends
   - Updates status to `'finalized'` on success
   - Broadcasts transfer events

4. **`app/api/transfer-basename/[basename]/route.ts`** ✅ (NEW)
   - Manual retry endpoint for failed transfers
   - POST to `/api/transfer-basename/x402agent.base.eth`
   - Only works if auction is `'ended'` (not `'finalized'`)

5. **`app/auction/[basename]/page.tsx`** ✅
   - Added UI for `basename_transferred` event (green success card)
   - Added UI for `basename_transfer_failed` event (orange warning card)
   - Links to Basescan for transaction verification

6. **`.env.example`** ✅
   - Added documentation about cross-network requirements
   - Clarified server wallet must own the Basename on Base Mainnet

## 🔧 Technical Details

### Basename → Token ID Conversion

```typescript
import { labelhash, normalize } from 'viem/ens'

// For "x402agent.base.eth"
const label = "x402agent"  // Extract label
const tokenId = labelhash(normalize(label))  // Convert to token ID
```

### ERC-721 Transfer

```typescript
// Contract: 0x03c4738ee98ae44591e1a4a4f3cab6641d95dd9a (Base Mainnet)
await walletClient.writeContract({
  address: BASENAME_CONTRACT_ADDRESS,
  abi: ERC721_ABI,
  functionName: 'safeTransferFrom',
  args: [serverAddress, winnerAddress, tokenId]
})
```

### Cross-Network Architecture

| Operation | Network | Purpose |
|-----------|---------|---------|
| **USDC Payments** | Base Sepolia | Agents pay bids, server issues refunds |
| **Basename Transfer** | Base Mainnet | Server transfers ERC-721 Basename to winner |

**Same wallet, different networks!** The `SERVER_WALLET_PRIVATE_KEY` is used for both, but with different chain configurations.

## 🧪 Testing the Feature

### Prerequisites

1. **Server wallet must own a Basename on Base Mainnet**
   - Check: `https://basescan.org/token/0x03c4738ee98ae44591e1a4a4f3cab6641d95dd9a?a=YOUR_WALLET_ADDRESS`

2. **Server wallet must have ETH on Base Mainnet** (for gas)
   - Check: `https://basescan.org/address/YOUR_WALLET_ADDRESS`

3. **Agents must have USDC on Base Sepolia** (for bidding)

### Testing Steps

1. **Start the server**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

2. **Start two intelligent agents**
   ```bash
   # Terminal 2
   npm run agent:ai:a

   # Terminal 3
   npm run agent:ai:b
   ```

3. **Open the auction UI**
   ```bash
   open http://localhost:3000/auction/x402agent.base.eth
   ```

4. **Watch the auction**
   - Agents will bid against each other
   - One agent will eventually withdraw
   - Auction ends automatically

5. **Verify transfer**
   - UI should show green "Basename Transferred!" card
   - Click "View on Basescan →" to see transaction
   - Verify winner now owns the Basename on Base Mainnet

### Manual Retry (if transfer fails)

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/transfer-basename/x402agent.base.eth
```

Expected response:
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "message": "Basename transferred successfully",
  "transactionHash": "0x...",
  "winner": "AgentA"
}
```

## 🚨 Common Issues & Solutions

### Issue 1: "Server does not own this Basename"

**Cause**: The server wallet doesn't own the Basename on Base Mainnet

**Solution**:
1. Transfer the Basename to your server wallet address on Base Mainnet
2. Or update `BASENAME_TO_AUCTION` to a Basename the server actually owns

### Issue 2: Transfer fails with "insufficient funds"

**Cause**: Server wallet has no ETH on Base Mainnet for gas

**Solution**:
```bash
# Bridge ETH to Base Mainnet for your server wallet
# Use Base Bridge: https://bridge.base.org/
```

### Issue 3: "Cannot read property 'walletAddress' of null"

**Cause**: No winner (auction ended with no bids)

**Solution**: This is expected behavior - transfer only happens if there's a winner

### Issue 4: Auction marked as 'ended' but not 'finalized'

**Cause**: Transfer failed but auction ended

**Solution**:
1. Check server logs for error details
2. Fix the issue (e.g., fund wallet, verify ownership)
3. Retry via manual endpoint:
   ```bash
   curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/transfer-basename/x402agent.base.eth
   ```

## 📊 Database States

| Status | Meaning | basenameTransferTxHash |
|--------|---------|------------------------|
| `'active'` | Auction in progress | `undefined` |
| `'ended'` | Auction ended, transfer failed or pending | `undefined` |
| `'finalized'` | Auction ended, Basename transferred | `"0x..."` |

## 🎉 Next Steps

Now that Basename transfers are working, you can:

1. **Test with real agents** - Run a full auction end-to-end
2. **Verify on Basescan** - Check that the Basename ownership changed
3. **Demo the feature** - Show how the winner automatically receives the domain
4. **Extend for poker** - Apply similar transfer logic to poker game rewards

## 📝 Code Quality

✅ **Type-safe** - Full TypeScript with proper types
✅ **Error handling** - Graceful failures with retry mechanism
✅ **Event broadcasting** - Real-time UI updates via SSE
