# ✅ System Ready to Test

## What Was Fixed

### 1. **Added Payment Verification** ✅
The server now properly verifies x402 payments before accepting bids.

### 2. **Added Payment Settlement** ✅  
The server settles payments on-chain, transferring USDC from agents to the server wallet.

### 3. **Fixed Concurrent Settlement Issue** ✅
Added a settlement lock to prevent "replacement transaction underpriced" errors when multiple agents bid simultaneously.

### 4. **Refunds Work as Economic Signals** ✅
Server sends direct USDC transfers to outbid agents, which they detect by monitoring their balance.

## How to Test

### Step 1: Start the Server
```bash
npm run dev
```

### Step 2: Start Agent A (in new terminal)
```bash
npm run agent:a
```

### Step 3: Start Agent B (in new terminal)  
```bash
npm run agent:b
```

## Expected Behavior

### First Bid (Agent A or B):
1. Agent calls `/api/bid/x402agent.base.eth`
2. Server returns 402 with payment requirements
3. Agent signs payment header
4. Server verifies payment ✅
5. Server settles payment on-chain ✅
6. **Agent's USDC balance decreases by $1**
7. **Server's USDC balance increases by $1**
8. Server returns 200 OK

### Second Bid (Other Agent):
1. Agent calls `/api/bid/x402agent.base.eth`
2. Server returns 402 (price now $2)
3. Agent signs payment for $2
4. Server verifies & settles ✅
5. **Agent's USDC balance decreases by $2**
6. **Server refunds $1 to first agent** 💸
7. **First agent detects refund** 🔔
8. First agent automatically retries with $3

## What You Should See in Logs

### Server Logs:
```
🔍 Verifying payment from AgentA...
✅ Payment verified from 0xAbF...
⛓️  Settling payment on-chain...
✅ Payment settled! Tx: 0x123...
💰 Bid accepted from AgentA: 1 USDC

🔍 Verifying payment from AgentB...
✅ Payment verified from 0xeDeE...
⛓️  Settling payment on-chain...
⏳ Waiting for previous settlement to complete... (if concurrent)
✅ Payment settled! Tx: 0x456...
💰 Bid accepted from AgentB: 2 USDC
🔄 Refunding 1 USDC to AgentA...
✅ Refund sent! Tx: 0x789...
```

### Agent A Logs:
```
💰 [AgentA] Attempting to bid...
💵 [AgentA] Current USDC balance: 29.27
✅ [AgentA] Bid successful!
   Current bid: $1
👀 [AgentA] Starting refund monitoring...

🔔 [AgentA] REFUND DETECTED: 1.00 USDC
   I've been outbid! 😤
⏳ [AgentA] Waiting 2s before retrying...
💰 [AgentA] Attempting to bid...
```

### Agent B Logs:
```
💰 [AgentB] Attempting to bid...
💵 [AgentB] Current USDC balance: 11.00
✅ [AgentB] Bid successful!
   Current bid: $2
👀 [AgentB] Starting refund monitoring...
```

## Key Improvements

1. **Settlement Lock**: Prevents nonce conflicts when agents bid simultaneously
2. **Proper Verification**: Server validates all payments before accepting
3. **On-Chain Settlement**: USDC actually transfers on Base Sepolia
4. **Economic Signals**: Refunds notify agents they've been outbid

## Troubleshooting

### If agents get 500 errors:
- Check server logs for the specific error
- Ensure server wallet has ETH for gas
- Verify agents have USDC for bidding

### If "replacement transaction underpriced":
- The lock should prevent this now
- If it still happens, agents are hitting the endpoint too fast
- The second agent will wait for the first to complete

### If refunds don't work:
- Check server wallet USDC balance
- Verify refund transaction on Base Sepolia explorer
- Agents monitor balance every 2 seconds

## Next Steps

Once testing confirms everything works:
1. Agents should see their balances change
2. Refunds should trigger automatic re-bidding
3. MongoDB should track all bids correctly
4. The auction should continue until time expires

## Summary

The system now implements the complete x402 flow from your idea.md:
- ✅ Agents express interest
- ✅ Server returns 402
- ✅ Agents sign payments
- ✅ Server verifies & settles on-chain
- ✅ Server refunds previous bidders
- ✅ Agents detect refunds and retry

**Ready to test!** 🚀
