# ðŸŽ¥ Real-Time Streaming Auction System

## Overview

The auction system now features **real-time Server-Sent Events (SSE)** streaming, providing a live, responsive experience where users see agent activity as it happens.

## Architecture

### 1. **Event Broadcasting (`lib/events.ts`)**
Central event emitter that manages SSE connections and broadcasts events to all connected clients.

```typescript
broadcastEvent(basename, {
  type: 'thinking' | 'bid_placed' | 'reflection' | 'refund',
  agentId: string,
  // ... event-specific data
});
```

### 2. **SSE Endpoint (`/api/stream/[basename]`)**
Establishes persistent connections with clients to push real-time updates.

### 3. **Status API (`/api/status`)**
Provides initial auction state when clients first connect (historical data).

## Event Flow

```
Agent Thinks
    â†“
Server broadcasts 'thinking' event
    â†“
Frontend shows thinking bubble with shimmer
    â†“
Agent pays & settlement completes
    â†“
Server broadcasts 'bid_placed' event
    â†“
Frontend shows bid card with loading state
    â†“
Agent completes reflection
    â†“
Server broadcasts 'reflection' event
    â†“
Frontend updates bid card with reflection
    â†“
Previous bidder gets refunded
    â†“
Server broadcasts 'refund' event
    â†“
Frontend shows system notification
```

## Event Types

### `thinking`
Broadcast when agent proposes a bid (before payment).

```json
{
  "type": "thinking",
  "agentId": "AgentA",
  "thinking": "Strategic opening bid...",
  "strategy": "intelligent",
  "proposedAmount": 3.50,
  "timestamp": "2025-10-18T..."
}
```

### `bid_placed`
Broadcast when payment settles on-chain.

```json
{
  "type": "bid_placed",
  "agentId": "AgentA",
  "amount": 3.50,
  "transactionHash": "0x...",
  "timestamp": "2025-10-18T..."
}
```

### `reflection`
Broadcast when agent's post-bid analysis arrives.

```json
{
  "type": "reflection",
  "agentId": "AgentA",
  "reflection": "My opening bid of $3.50...",
  "timestamp": "2025-10-18T..."
}
```

### `refund`
Broadcast when a previous bidder is refunded.

```json
{
  "type": "refund",
  "agentId": "AgentA",
  "amount": 3.00,
  "transactionHash": "0x...",
  "timestamp": "2025-10-18T..."
}
```

## Frontend Experience

### Progressive Loading States

1. **Thinking Bubble** - Appears instantly with shimmer effect
2. **Bid Card** - Shows payment amount and transaction link
3. **Shimmer Loading** - Animated placeholder while waiting for reflection
4. **Reflection Card** - Appears below bid with strategic analysis
5. **Refund Notification** - System message in center

### UI Components

```tsx
// Thinking bubble (left/right aligned by agent)
<div className="thinking-bubble">
  ðŸ’­ Thinking...
  "Strategic opening bid..."
  Strategy: intelligent
</div>

// Bid card with loading state
<div className="bid-card">
  Bid placed: $3.50 USDC
  [View on Basescan â†’]
  
  {isLoading ? (
    <shimmer-animation />
  ) : (
    <reflection-card />
  )}
</div>

// Refund notification (center)
<div className="refund-notification">
  ðŸ’¸ AgentA was outbid and refunded $3.00 [tx]
</div>
```

## Benefits

âœ… **Real-time** - No polling, instant updates via SSE push  
âœ… **Progressive** - See thinking â†’ bid â†’ reflection in sequence  
âœ… **Loading states** - Shimmer animations show agents are processing  
âœ… **Better UX** - Feels alive and responsive like a chat app  
âœ… **Scalable** - SSE efficiently handles multiple concurrent viewers  
âœ… **Reliable** - Automatic reconnection on connection loss  

## Testing

1. **Start the server:**
   ```bash
   cd /Users/ashnouruzi/x402-bids/agent-bid
   npm run dev
   ```

2. **Open auction page:**
   ```
   http://localhost:3000/auction/yourname.base.eth
   ```

3. **Run agents in separate terminals:**
   ```bash
   # Terminal 1
   npm run agent:ai:a
   
   # Terminal 2
   npm run agent:ai:b
   ```

4. **Watch the magic:**
   - See thinking bubbles appear instantly
   - Watch bid cards stream in
   - See shimmer loading while agents reflect
   - Watch reflections populate below bids
   - See refund notifications in real-time

## Debugging

Check SSE connection in browser DevTools:
- Network tab â†’ Filter by "stream"
- Should see persistent connection with `text/event-stream`
- Events appear as they're broadcast

Check server logs:
```
ðŸ“¡ SSE connection registered for yourname.base.eth (1 total)
ðŸ“¡ Broadcasting thinking to 1 client(s)
ðŸ“¡ Broadcasting bid_placed to 1 client(s)
ðŸ“¡ Broadcasting reflection to 1 client(s)
```

## Technical Details

- **Transport:** Server-Sent Events (SSE)
- **Format:** JSON over `text/event-stream`
- **Reconnection:** Automatic via browser EventSource API
- **Concurrency:** Multiple clients per basename supported
- **Memory:** Connections cleaned up on disconnect
- **Latency:** ~50-100ms from server to client
